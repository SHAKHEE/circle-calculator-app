1. General Equation Inputs
Method: Input coefficients for the general circle equation: x² + y² + Cx + Dy + E = 0
How it works: The app calculates the center (h,k) using h = -C/2 and k = -D/2, and the radius using r = √(h² + k² - E)
When to use: When you already know the general form equation of a circle
Example: For x² + y² - 4x + 6y - 12 = 0, the center is (2, -3) and radius is 5

2. Circle from 3 Points
Method: Input coordinates of three distinct points that lie on the circle's circumference
How it works: The app solves a system of equations derived from substituting each point into the general circle equation
When to use: When you know three points that lie on a circle but don't know its center or radius
Mathematical basis: The perpendicular bisectors of any two chords of a circle intersect at the center

3. Circle from 2 Endpoints of Diameter
Method: Input the coordinates of both endpoints of a diameter
How it works: The center is calculated as the midpoint between the two endpoints, and the radius is half the distance between them
When to use: When you know the exact diameter of a circle
Key property: The angle in a semicircle is always a right angle (90°)

4. Circle from Center + 1 Point
Method: Input the center coordinates and one point on the circumference
How it works: The radius is calculated as the distance between the center and the given point
When to use: When you know the center and one point on the circle
Example: Center at (0,0) and point at (3,4) gives a circle with radius 5

5. Circle with Center on a Line + 2 Points
Method: Input a line equation (y = mx + c) and two points on the circle
How it works: The app finds the center by solving for the point on the given line that is equidistant from both given points
When to use: When you know the circle's center lies on a specific line and two points on the circle
Application: Useful in constraint-based geometric problems where the center has specific positional requirements
